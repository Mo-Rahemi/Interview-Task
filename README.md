# Taaghche-Task
This is an Interview Task for Taaghche company witch is a book startup (https://taaghche.com/).

Problem :
impelement one of book APIs that cache requests with multiple cache layers. (like memory - redis - other db - etc)
so if user search for book metadata with an id application search in layers if data not found call API.

This is good example to show how to use code patterns and write an extendable/scalable code.

Technologies :
.net core 3.1 + asp.net core + Redis + clean architecture
