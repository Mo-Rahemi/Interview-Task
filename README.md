# Taaghche-Task
This is an Interview Task for Taaghche company witch is a book startup (https://taaghche.com/).

Problem :
impelement one of book APIs that cache requests. (like memory - redis - other db - etc)
so if user want book metadata with book id it will search for data one by one in catch layers.

This is good example to show how to use code pattern and how to think for extendable solutions.

Technologies :
.net core 3.1 + asp.net core + Redis

regards.
